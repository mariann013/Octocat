Explain what a branch is, in your own words:

A branch is a version of the project which can be created from any point that exists in the project and can then be worked on as a seperate entity
without affecting the master of the projects and then can be merged back into the master branch. It allows teams to work on multiple features of one 
projects simulataniously.
